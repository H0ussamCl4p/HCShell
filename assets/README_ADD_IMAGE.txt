Place the screenshot image you attached here so the README can display it.

Filename (relative to repo root): assets/screenshot.png

Recommended steps:
1. Save the attached PNG screenshot as `assets/screenshot.png`.
2. From the project root, run:

   git add assets/screenshot.png
   git commit -m "docs: add HCShell screenshot"
   git push

Notes:
- The README references `assets/screenshot.png` and will display it on GitHub and other renderers.
- If you prefer a different name or location, update the `src` path in `README.md` accordingly.
